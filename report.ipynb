    "Recently at AAVAIL there has been discussion among management about different approaches to revenue generation. AAVAIL launched using a tiered, subscription-based service which showed promise, but conversations with users, especially those outside of US markets, prompted an experiment using an Ã  la carte approach. This experiment was carried out mostly outside of the US and there are now a couple of years of data with a few thousand active users. The data are transaction-level purchases across 38 different countries and are invoiced in batches. Management has nearly decided to make the switch to the new model, but they find it difficult to predict monthly revenue. They have asked you to create a service that, at any point in time, will predict the revenue for the following month. They have also asked that the service be given the ability to project revenue for a specific country. To keep the development time reasonable you have been advised to limit your model to the ten countries with the most revenue."

    "You have spoken at length with the managers who will be the end users of this model and they are confident that this product will have a meaningful business impact. Currently, these managers are using their own methods to predict revenue, but they have come to feel that they are spending too much time on this and their lack of expertise in data science means their predictions are not as accurate as they would like. The management team expects to spend less time creating their own projection models, and they expect the new results to be more accurate. They have assured you that well-projected numbers will help stabilize staffing and budget projections which will have a beneficial ripple effect throughout the company."

If you decide to use a supervised learning approach to this prediction problem, we will provide some guidance with respect to feature engineering. We will also talk about the use of time-series modeling approaches, but both of these topics will be in the next part of the case study. First, you need to understand the business scenario in the context of available data and carry out an investigation. The goals of this part of the case study are below."

We cannot cover the breadth and depth of this important area of data science in a single case study. We do however want to use this as a learning opportunity if time-series analysis is new to you. For those of you who are seasoned practitioners in this area, it may be a useful time to hone your skills or try out a more advanced technique like Gaussian processes. The reference materials for more advanced approaches to time-series analysis will occur in their own section below. If this is your first encounter with time-series data we suggest that that you begin with the supervised learning approach before trying out the other possible methods."
